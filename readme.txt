Create html tables using a visual edtior.

== Description ==
Creating and managing colorful tables has never been more intuitive and straightforward with this plugin.

The visual editor will keep you away from **coding and shortcode** complexity.

Apply cell color, font color and font styles.

The plugin has two handy import functions - used shortcodes and delimiter-separated text, which will create the table automatically for you. It also completely avoids the site database, thus making it lightweight and easily transferable between different posts or wordpress installations.
